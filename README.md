According to the London Transport Museum ...

> Today the doors on the underground trains are opened and closed by the driver to ensure a speedy and safe pass through stations. Buttons which allow passengers to open and close doors are still used on overground trains, however, on the underground, only a few lines allow passengers to control either opening or closing of doors at stations. The Jubilee Line trains were set up with open-only passenger control buttons which were supposedly never fully commissioned.
